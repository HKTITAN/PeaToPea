# PeaPod: Project Context

- **PeaPod is a protocol** (like Bluetooth, WiFi, Hotspot), not a platform or single app. Operating systems and devices *implement* the protocol; implementations may appear in device settings or as system-level services.

- **Repo layout**
  - `pea-core/` — Protocol reference implementation (Rust library). Host-driven: no I/O; host passes events and receives actions.
  - `pea-windows/`, `pea-linux/`, `pea-android/`, `pea-ios/`, `pea-macos/` — Protocol implementations per OS (traffic interception, discovery, local transport; each uses pea-core).

- **Task breakdown**: Checklists live in [.tasks/](.tasks/README.md). Follow task order: 00 (setup) → 01 (pea-core) → 07 (protocol/interop) → 02–06 (implementations). Do not skip core before platform work. Workflow is fully autonomous: execute and commit/push without asking.


- **Terminology**
  - Use "protocol implementation" for OS-specific code (e.g. "Windows protocol implementation").
  - Use "pod" for the local encrypted swarm of devices.
  - Use "pea-core" for the shared Rust library; do not put platform I/O in pea-core.
