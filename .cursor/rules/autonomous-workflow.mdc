# Fully autonomous workflow

This project runs in **fully autonomous mode**. Do not ask the user for confirmation for:

- **Shell commands**: Run `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and any other commands needed for the task. Hooks auto-allow execution.
- **Subagents**: Dispatch to explore, shell, or generalPurpose subagents as needed without asking.
- **Commits and pushes**: After each logical chunk (task item or section done), run build/test if Rust changed, then `git add`, `git commit` with a clear message, and `git push`. Do not prompt.
- **Continuing**: When a chunk is done, the session will auto-continue to the next .tasks item via the stop hook. Proceed without asking.

Execute the full cycle: **implement from .tasks → verify (cargo build/test) → commit → push → continue to next item**. No confirmation steps.
