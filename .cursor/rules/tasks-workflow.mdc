# .tasks Workflow

- **Format**: .tasks files are checklists. Use `- [ ]` for unchecked and `- [x]` for done. Structure with `##` (task), `###` (subtask), `####` (sub-subtask).

- **Autonomous**: Execute without asking for confirmation. Run build/test, commit, push, and continue to the next item. Hooks allow commands and auto-continue.

- **When implementing from a task file**: Open the relevant file (e.g. [.tasks/01-pea-core.md](.tasks/01-pea-core.md)). Implement unchecked items in order; mark completed items with `[x]`. Do not mark items done until the work is verified (e.g. build and tests pass).

- **Adding tasks**: Add new sub-tasks only when they fit the existing hierarchy. Prefer adding under an existing `####` or `###` rather than creating new top-level sections. Keep tasks small and actionable.

- **Adding from requirements**: When you or the user identify a new requirement or dependency, add a corresponding task or sub-task to the right .tasks file; preserve hierarchy and order.

- **Findings and notes**: When you discover something worth remembering (design choice, root cause, limitation), add it under the relevant task or in a `## Notes` section at the end of the file (see .tasks/README.md).

- **Order**: Respect the recommended order in [.tasks/README.md](.tasks/README.md). Do not start a protocol implementation (02–06) before pea-core (01) and protocol/interop (07) are in a good state.
